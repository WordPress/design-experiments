A plugin for trying out design experiments in WP-Admin. Brought to you by the WordPress Design Team.

== Description ==

The Design Experiments plugin is a tool for prototyping designs within the context of WP-Admin. It contains a number of proof-of-concepts that the [WordPress Design Team](http://make.wordpress.org/design/) is exploring. 

An important disclaimer: This plugin is called experimental for a reason. It is for testing concepts, and is not intended for use on a production site. These experiments may hide or visually break functionality in the admin area. Some of the experiments may break after a while, and will be removed from the plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Design Experimentst screen to activate an experiment.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I do if an experiment appears broken? =

These are rough proof-of-concepts, so some breakage is generally expected. If you'd like to follow up with the team who built the plugin though, you may [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/design-experiments/issues). 

= I have an idea for an experiment, how do I submit it? =

If you'd like to build your own experiment, or just submit an idea, you can do so by at [the plugin's GitHub page](https://github.com/WordPress/design-experiments).
