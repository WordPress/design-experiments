A plugin for trying out design experiments in WP-Admin. Brought to you by the WordPress Design Team.

== Description ==

The Design Experiments plugin is a tool for prototyping designs within the context of WP-Admin. It contains a number of proof of concepts that the [WordPress Design Team](http://make.wordpress.org/design/) is exploring. 

An important disclaimer: This plugin is called experimental for a reason. It is for testing concepts, and is not intended for use on a production site. These experiments may hide or visually break functionality in the admin area. Some of the experiments may break after a while, and will be removed from the plugin. Do not rely on this plugin for permanent changes to your site.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Design Experiments screen to activate an experiment.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I do if an experiment appears broken? =

= I have an idea for an experiment, how do I submit it? =
